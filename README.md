I work on XR / computer vision systems with a focus on Meta Quest and Unity-based pipelines.
My repositories mainly cover **Quest device capture**, **passthrough-based 3D reconstruction**, and **geometry-aware vision algorithms**.

### 🔹 Featured Projects
- **SimpleUnity3DWebView**  
  Lightweight 3D WebView integration for Unity on Android, designed for practical XR applications.

- **QuestRealityCapture / metaquest-3d-reconstruction**  
  End-to-end pipeline for capturing passthrough, depth, and poses from Meta Quest devices and reconstructing 3D scenes using Open3D, TSDF, COLMAP, and Gaussian Splatting.

- **QuestMediaProjection / MetaQuestScreenshotLoader**  
  Utilities for screen capture, screenshot retrieval, and barcode scanning on Meta Quest via Android MediaProjection.

- **Cuboid-DETR**  
  Geometry-driven 2D cuboid detection with joint bounding box and symmetry-aware keypoint prediction, aimed at structured object understanding.

Most repositories are research-oriented but designed to be directly usable in real-world XR systems.
